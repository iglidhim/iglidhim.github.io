        <h2>2. Smelly shoes</h2>
        <p>If you have bad-smelling shoes, place a few dry tea bags inside each shoe to absorb the smell.</br>
        If your shoes are not just smelly but also wet, fill them with a mixture of rice and baking soda and leave for a few days.</p>

        <h2>3. Tight shoes:</h2>
        <p>If your new shoes feel too tight, here's a way to stretch them.</br>

        Let the shoes dry, and then remove the newspaper.</p>

        <h2>4. Find small lost items:</h2>
        <p>Use your vacuum cleaner to find tiny items you've lost, such as earrings.</br>
        Just cover the end of a vacuum cleaner with a stocking or pantyhose, and start your search.</br>
        Check from time to time to see if the object you are looking for is already there.</p>
