  <h1>!!!Best Five Lifehacks!!!</h1>
    <h2>1. Waterproof shoes:</h2>
    <div>
      <ul>To turn your canvas shoes into waterproof ones, you need nothing but beeswax and a blow dryer. Spread beeswax all over your shoes. Next, use the blow dryer to melt the beeswax until you can no longer see it. Voila! Your waterproof shoes are ready!</ul>
    </div>
    <h2>2. Smelly shoes:</h2>
    <div>
      <ul>If you have bad-smelling shoes, place a few dry tea bags inside each shoe to absorb the smell. If your shoes are not just smelly but also wet, fill them with a mixture of rice and baking soda and leave for a few days.</ul>
    </div>
    <h2>3. Tight shoes:</h2>
    <div>
      <ul>If your new shoes feel too tight, here's a way to stretch them. Stuff each shoe with wet newspaper as tightly as you can. Let the shoes dry, and then remove the newspaper.</ul>
    </div>
    <h2>4. Find small lost items:</h2>
    <div>
      <ul>Use your vacuum cleaner to find tiny items you've lost, such as earrings. Just cover the end of a vacuum cleaner with a stocking or pantyhose, and start your search. Check from time to time to see if the object you are looking for is already there.</ul>
    </div>
    <h2>5. Keep buttons from falling off:</h2>
    <div>
      <ul>To keep your buttons in place, simply paint a bit of clear nail polish over the threads.</ul>
