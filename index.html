  <h1>!!!Igli's Best Five Lifehacks!!!</h1>
  <h2>1. Waterproof shoes:</h2>
    <div>
      <img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" src="../iglidhim.github.io/images/waterproof.jpeg" width="300" height="200"/>
      <div style="float:left;"></div>
        <p>To turn your canvas shoes into waterproof ones, you need nothing but beeswax and a blow dryer. Spread beeswax all over your shoes. Next, use the blow dryer to melt the beeswax until you can no longer see it. Voila! Your waterproof shoes are ready!</p>
      
    </div>
  <h3>2. Smelly shoes:</h3>
    <div>
      <img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" src="../iglidhim.github.io/images/smelly.jpeg" width="300" height="200"/>
      <div style="float:left;"></div>
      <p>If you have bad-smelling shoes, place a few dry tea bags inside each shoe to absorb the smell. If your shoes are not just smelly but also wet, fill them with a mixture of rice and baking soda and leave for a few days.</p>
      
    </div>
  <h4>3. Tight shoes:</h4>
    <div>
      <img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" src="../iglidhim.github.io/images/tight.jpeg" width="300" height="200"/>
      <div style="float:left;"></div>
      <p>If your new shoes feel too tight, here's a way to stretch them. Stuff each shoe with wet newspaper as tightly as you can. Let the shoes dry, and then remove the newspaper.</p>
     
    </div>
  <h5>4. Find small lost items:</h5>
    <div>
      <img src="../iglidhim.github.io/images/smallitems.jpeg" width="300" height="200" ali/>
      <div style="float:left;"></div>
      <p>Use your vacuum cleaner to find tiny items you've lost, such as earrings. Just cover the end of a vacuum cleaner with a stocking or pantyhose, and start your search. Check from time to time to see if the object you are looking for is already there.</p>
      
    </div>
  <h6>5. Keep buttons from falling off:</h6>
    <div>
      <img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" src="../iglidhim.github.io/images/keepbuttons.jpeg" width="300" height="200"/>
      <div style="float:left;"></div>
      <p>To keep your buttons in place, simply paint a bit of clear nail polish over the threads.</p>
